### Language Option

On the first page load you will see "EN" word beside of "Add a Flashcard".

"EN" stands for English and the default options is in English.

Currently there are four options to select a language.
- English - EN
- German - GR
- Polish - PL
- Turkish - TR

When one of those will be selected the language of the page will change to it.

### Switch Button

On the first page load you will see a switch button with a ball in it between "EN" and "Select a Flash Card".

This button is to change the theme of the website.

Default option to use the page is in dark mode with a black background.

When clicked or focus + enter the button, it will move to the other side of its location and theme will be changed to bright mode.

Bright mode uses a white background on the page.

### Select a Flashcard
    
This button will not do anything if you are using the page first time.

If you already saved a card when you click on this button, it will slide up the card saving area if it is already open and show up the type or types you saved your card or cards.

When you click one type button it will show the card saving area with extra buttons in it and below of it, the cards you saved will be visible.
        
1. Card Saving Area

    - As explained under "Add a Flashcard", card saving area will keep the elements it has before and will have two extra buttons and with one change.
    - The only change from the original area is input type area. It is now can not be changed and has the text of the type's name.
    - You can save a card to a type while using the "Select a Flashcard" button also.

## WHICH BROWSERs AND SCREEN SIZEs ARE OPTIMIZED?

I mainly used Edge to create this project. Still I checked Opera and Chrome for apperance and I did not see any mistake from the original.
